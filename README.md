# Fancy Hello World!
A program that provides fun ways to print the classic "Hello World!" text.

An interface is displayed upon running the program that allows you to select options.

### Current Options:
**rando** - builds the string character by character by cycling randomly through characters until a match per index

**scrambled** - builds the string by generating random characters for each index, stopping each index when it matches

**rain** - spreads the string's characters from top to bottom like droplets

**colorful** - randomly applies colors to each character in the string
